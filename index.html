                    very techsavvy, and am an absolute weeb in nature cause of my love for anime. I also do Enviorment Rendering on the 
                    side. (image above still in progress). I've always been interested in design since the start of high school which led 
                    me to where I am today. The reason I say “<em>former game design student</em>” was because as semester 2 came around I 
                    experienced some personal problems which still affect me today. However hasn't stopped me from being myself and trying
                    my best to work my hardest. There are those days though and they do happen most often. However I've
                    been learning to trek through it. Currently as im learning throughout this course I haven't abandoned my
                    Game Design roots and still wish to get in the game design industry after I graduate from GBC</p>
